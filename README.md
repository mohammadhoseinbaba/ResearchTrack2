The assignment of Research Track 2 course consist of three parts that are presented in this repository as shown below:

## Software Documentation
For this assignment, I used **Sphinx** to document the code I wrote for the second assignment in the Research Track 1 course. Within the associated GitHub repository, there are files relevant to this assignment under the `documents` folder.


## Jupyter Notebook

The second assignment focuses on utilizing Jupyter to create a graphical interface that allows user interaction for performing various actions. These actions include:

1. Incorporating buttons for controlling the motion of the robot within the environment.
2. Generating a plot that displays the positions of the robot and the targets within the environment.
3. Including a text box that provides the distance to the nearest obstacle.
4. Creating a plot illustrating the count of reached and not-reached targets.

By implementing these features within the Jupyter Notebook, users can intuitively control the robot's movements, visualize its position and the positions of the targets, receive information about obstacle distances, and monitor the progress of target achievements.
Within the associated GitHub repository, there is a file relevant to this assignment named `Research Track 2 _ Assignment2.ipynb`.


## Statistical Analysis

The third assignment involves conducting a statistical analysis to assess the performance of two algorithms. The comparison is carried out between the program developed by me and the program developed by my colleague, both of which were created as part of the first assignment in the Research Track1 course.
The analysis consists of collecting data, formulating hypotheses, performing the analysis, and drawing conclusions based on the results. The comprehensive report documenting the entire analysis is titled `RT2_report.pdf `and contains detailed information regarding the conducted analysis, including methodologies, findings, and conclusions.
